# Search Things

An extension to search using multiple sites at once!

- It creates a group of tabs of different websites that use the search term provided
  - The group is named after the search term.
- The extension can be shown through a keyboard shortcut
  - The shortcut can be changed in the Extensions Settings.
  - Defaults:
    - Windows/Linux: `Control` + `Shift` + `S`
    - macOS: `Command` + `Shift` + `S`
- You can add/remove groups and pages in the Options page.
  - When adding a page, you can specify the search_term by adding `{{}}` in the URL.
    - e.g. `https://www.google.com/search?q={{}}` to search the term on google
    - It can also be used multiple times if needed
      - e.g. `https://www.baidu.com/s?wd={{}}&oq={{}}`

I use this to search for news or stock information from multiple sources and I am finding it pretty neat!
